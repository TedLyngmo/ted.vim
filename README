This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1635

This is my colorscheme, based on [candycode.vim]. It uses a (nearly) black background contrasted with bright pastel colors.
The main difference between this and _candycode_ is that comments are shown in amber (GUI)/yellow(terminal) instead of brown.
